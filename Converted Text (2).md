DRUG DISCOVERY: PROTEIN AS DRUG TARGET 

INTRODUCTIONIn drug discovery, a protein is considered a drug target when it plays an important role in the development or progression of a disease and can be modulated by a therapeutic agent (such as a small molecule, peptide, or antibody) to produce a desired therapeutic effect. Drug targets are typically proteins such as enzymes, receptors, ion channels, or transcription factors, whose activity or expression is directly linked to the disease pathology. By interacting with these proteins, drugs can alter and change biological pathways, leading to the mitigation or cure of the disease. The process of identifying and validating these proteins as targets is important in the development of new drugs.

THE ROLE OF PROTEIN IN DISEASE PATHOLOGY
The vast majority of approved drugs are proteins. Knowledge of which proteins are the targets of approved drugs enables the proved drugs are proteins. Knowledge of which proteins are the targets of approved drugs enables the division of the human proteome into two classes: approved drug targets and non-targets. A protein is an approved drug target if it is the target of an approved drug, and a non-target otherwise.In order for a protein to have any potential as a drug target it must be druggable. A druggable protein is one that possesses folds that favour interactions with small drug-like molecules, be they endogenous or extraneous, and therefore is one that contains a binding site. These binding sites are expected to have certain characteristics that enable high affinity site-specific binding by the drug-like molecule. As with all drug targets, a potential protein drug target must be linked to a disease process. into two classes: approved drug targets and non-targets.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, proteins are very important target in cancer therapy. More research and development of protein targeted drugs hold promise for treating various cancers and improving patient outcomes.With the current advances going on, more effective treatments are to emerge.However, targeting proteins in drug discovery also presents challenges, such as ensuring specificity and minimizing off-target effects. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of protein drug targets make them an important area of focus for future research and development. As our understanding of protein structure and function continues to evolve, we can expect to see new and innovative approaches to targeting proteins in drug discovery.
